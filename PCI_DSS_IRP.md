# PCI DSS Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## Purpose
This **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** provides a structured approach to detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents involving cardholder data (CHD) in compliance with **PCI DSS v4.0**. It ensures swift incident resolution, minimizes data exposure, and aligns with applicable regulatory requirements.

---

## Scope
This plan applies to all systems, employees, vendors, and contractors involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of CHD within the organization.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

The **Incident Response Team (IRT)** ensures compliance with PCI DSS **Requirement 12.10.5** by clearly defining roles and responsibilities.

| **Role**                  | **Responsibility**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Incident Response Manager** | Coordinates the response process and ensures compliance with PCI DSS requirements.         |
| **Forensic Specialist**   | Conducts analysis and preserves evidence in compliance with **Requirement 10.7**.  |
| **IT Specialist**         | Implements containment, eradication, and recovery strategies as per **Requirement 6.6**. |
| **Compliance Officer**    | Ensures actions align with PCI DSS and regulatory requirements (**Requirement 12.1**).|
| **Communications Lead**   | Manages internal and external communications to meet **Requirement 12.10.1**.       |

---

## Incident Categories

Incidents are categorized based on their impact on CHD and related systems, aligning with PCI DSS **Requirement 12.10.3**.

| **Category**    | **Examples**                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low Impact**   | Suspicious but non-critical activity (e.g., failed login attempts).         |
| **Medium Impact**| Potential CHD exposure (e.g., unauthorized access or vulnerabilities).      |
| **High Impact**  | Confirmed CHD breach (e.g., malware attacks or critical system compromise). |

## Incident Response Procedures

### Step 1: Identification
- Use monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity, as per **Requirement 10.6**:
  - **SIEM**: Log analysis (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).
  - **Endpoint Detection**: Detect malware (e.g., CrowdStrike, FireEye).
  - **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** for real-time threat detection (**Requirement 6.6**).
- Validate incidents by reviewing:
  - Logs (**Requirement 10.5**).
  - Alerts and user activity patterns.
- Classify the severity based on CHD impact (**Requirement 12.10.3**).

---

### Step 2: Containment
- Implement **short-term containment** measures as per **Requirement 12.10.4**:
  - Disconnect affected systems from the network.
  - Disable compromised user accounts (**Requirement 8.1.4**).
- Implement **long-term containment** strategies:
  - Apply patches and updates (**Requirement 6.2**).
  - Strengthen firewall and IDS/IPS configurations (**Requirement 1.2**).

---

### Step 3: Eradication
- Eliminate threats while maintaining CHD security (**Requirement 6.5**):
  - Remove malware or unauthorized tools.
  - Update antivirus and endpoint security tools (**Requirement 5.1**).
  - Conduct vulnerability scans to confirm systems are clean (**Requirement 11.2**).

---

### Step 4: Recovery
- Restore operations securely (**Requirement 12.10.5**):
  - Rebuild affected systems from validated, secure backups (**Requirement 9.5**).
  - Verify system security and test functionality before reconnecting to production environments (**Requirement 6.6**).
  - Monitor for any recurring issues.

---

### Step 5: Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review within **10 business days**:
  - Document root cause analysis (**Requirement 12.10.7**).
  - Timeline actions and identify preventive measures to reduce future risks.

---

## Incident Reporting

- Notify stakeholders within **24 hours** of an incident as per **Requirement 12.10.1**.
- Provide incident details to regulatory bodies when required (**Requirement 12.10.2**).
- Maintain a detailed incident log:
  - Date and time of the incident (**Requirement 10.3**).
  - Systems and data affected.
  - Actions taken during response.

---

## Evidence Preservation

- Preserve the following as per **Requirement 10.7**:
  - Logs (network, system, and application).
  - Forensic images of affected systems.
  - Emails and communications related to the incident.
- Store evidence securely to maintain the chain of custody.

---

## Communication Plan

- **Internal Communication**:
  - Notify team members and employees via predefined channels (**Requirement 12.10.4**).
- **External Communication**:
  - Only authorized personnel (e.g., Communications Lead) may release information externally.
  - Collaborate with third-party forensic investigators or legal teams if required (**Requirement 12.9**).

---

## Training and Testing

- Conduct annual training for all employees handling CHD as per **Requirement 12.6**.
- Test the IRP through tabletop exercises or simulated breach scenarios at least once per year (**Requirement 12.10.2**).

---

## Policy Review

- The IRP must be reviewed and updated:
  - Annually (**Requirement 12.11**).
  - After significant changes to systems or business processes.
  - Following a security incident (**Requirement 12.10.5**).
